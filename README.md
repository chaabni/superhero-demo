# Example project for Vaadin Components

To run:
```
$ bower install vaadin-components
$ serve .
```
Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/index.html)

If you do not have Bower, see its install [instructions](http://bower.io/#install-bower)

If you do not have Serve, deploy the files using any HTTP server or
install [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve)

Note that opening the files locally won't work because browsers tend
to block HTML imports from file:// URLs
