# Example project for Vaadin Components

To run:
>bower install

>serve .

If you do not have bower, see http://bower.io/#install-bower

If you do not have serve, deploy the files using any HTTP server or install serve (https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve)
Note that opening the files locally won't work because browsers tend to block HTML imports from file:// URLs
